# To all the people looking at this repo and thinking of what's up.
Hey guys it's ya boi zwe. I've wrote your assignments for you! Ta-Da!
But it's not as simple as that. I don't want any of you to get into trouble - remember - you're most likely not the only one who's looking at these files.
There's at least ten other people who will also be basing their code off of this repository.

So before you copy the entire codebase, think. Do I want to get into trouble for plagiarism? No. You probably don't.

SO! 

If you're new to this thing, don't worry. I'll inform you some stuff about what you should and shouldn't do.

## DONT's:

- Don't fucking download and submit my assignment. There's always that one idiot who thinks they can get away with it. For the love of god don't.
- Don't tell other people about this link. The less people that know, the better. If someone wants this code, ask them to ask me first. Please.
- Don't be a little snitch.

## DO's : 

- DO ADD ALL YOUR OWN COMMENTS. COMMENTING IS EXPLAINED IN DETAIL IN YOUR ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS. DON'T FUCK AROUND WITH THIS PART. 
- DO TELL ME IF THERE’S ANY ERRORS OR PROBLEMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I’ll get to correcting it for other people.
- Do try to write your own assignments and use this only as a marker for when you get stuck. I get it, Python's hard. But hey, I did it - you'll be able to too.
- Do try to change all the variable names before submission. You can do this manually, or pycharm has this really nice function called refactoring where you can alter all variable names. Google "Pycharm refactor" if you don't know what I'm on about.
- Do try to change the kivy colors. If you're really rushing the assignment, this can be done in the build_widgets functions of main.py.
- Do try to thank me after. It's a loveless job, and a lonely job most of the time. 

*Zwe, your knight in shining armor in your time of need.*
